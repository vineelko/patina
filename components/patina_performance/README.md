# Patina Performance Component

The Patina performance component acts as the translation layer between the core's performance implementation, and the
UEFI and ACPI implementations.

## Responsibilities

- Publish the FBPT at End of DXE so the operating system can consume it later.
- Expose the EDK II measurement protocol (`EdkiiPerformanceMeasurement`) for C drivers that need to log performance
  data.
- Publish performance properties through a configuration table.
- Optionally merge Management Mode (MM) performance records when an MM communication region is available.

## Configuration

Whether performance measurement is enabled is decided by the DXE Core, not by this component. The core resolves the
performance configuration from a `PerformanceConfigHob`, falling back to the platform-provided
`PlatformInfo::DEFAULT_PERFORMANCE_CONFIG` when no such HOB is present. When performance is enabled the core
publishes the [`PerformanceManager`] service; when it is disabled that service is absent, so this component's
service dependency is unsatisfied and it does not dispatch.

A platform therefore enables performance in one of two ways:

1. Production of the `PerformanceConfigHob` prior to Patina DXE Core execution (this takes priority), or
2. Setting `PlatformInfo::DEFAULT_PERFORMANCE_CONFIG` to an enabled configuration with the desired `Measurement` values.

```rust,ignore
use patina::performance::config::PerformanceConfig;
use patina_dxe_core::*;

struct ExamplePlatform;

impl PlatformInfo for ExamplePlatform {
    // Optional override if the platform does not publish the performance configuration HOB.
    const DEFAULT_PERFORMANCE_CONFIG: PerformanceConfig = PerformanceConfig::new()
        .with_measurement(patina::performance::Measurement::DriverBindingStart) // Adds driver binding start measurements.
        .with_measurement(patina::performance::Measurement::DriverBindingStop)  // Adds driver binding stop measurements.
        .with_measurement(patina::performance::Measurement::LoadImage)          // Adds load image measurements.
        .with_measurement(patina::performance::Measurement::StartImage);        // Adds start image measurements.
}

impl ComponentInfo for ExamplePlatform {
    fn components(mut add: Add<Component>) {
        // The component dispatches only when the DXE Core enables performance measurement, via a performance
        // config HOB or the platform's `PlatformInfo::DEFAULT_PERFORMANCE_CONFIG` override.
        add.component(patina_performance::component::Performance::new());
    }
}
```

## API

The functions below are provided by the [`PerformanceManager`] service (produced by the DXE Core) and the core
internals; this component makes them reachable from external C modules through the `EdkiiPerformanceMeasurement`
protocol.

### Logging Performance Measurements

Performance measurements are recorded through the [`PerformanceManager`] service, which is produced by the DXE
Core and consumed both internally by the core and by components via dependency injection.

*Example of recording a measurement through the service:*

```rust,no_run
# extern crate patina;
use patina::component::service::{Service, performance::PerformanceManager};
use patina::guids::CALLER_ID;

fn record(perf: Service<dyn PerformanceManager>) {
    perf.perf_cross_module_begin("DXE", CALLER_ID.as_efi_guid());
}
```

[`PerformanceManager`]: patina::component::service::performance::PerformanceManager

## Performance Component Overview

The performance measurement API is provided by the [`PerformanceManager`] service, which is produced by the DXE
Core. This component contributes the UEFI-facing pieces on top of it:

- The EDK II Performance Measurement protocol, produced by this component, for use by external (C) modules.
- Publishing of the FBPT and performance properties.

Patina code (core or components) records measurements through the [`PerformanceManager`] service. External modules
use the function returned by the `EdkiiPerformanceMeasurement` protocol, which routes back into the same service.

---

### Initialization and Setup

The DXE Core initializes the FBPT, seeds it with any pre-DXE performance HOB data, and applies the measurement mask
before this component runs. Upon initialization, the component performs the following steps:

1. **Install the `EdkiiPerformanceMeasurement` Protocol**

   - Enables external modules to log performance data through the measurement service.

2. **Register Events**

   - One event collects performance records logged in Management Mode (MM).
   - Another event publishes the FBPT to allocate the table in reserved memory at the end of the DXE phase.

3. **Install Performance Properties**

   - Exposes performance-related properties through a configuration table for use by other components.

---

### Scope and Limitations

This component **only publishes the FBPT**, as it specifically manages the additional record fields within it.
Other tables, such as the **Firmware Performance Data Table (FPDT)**, are published by separate components.
