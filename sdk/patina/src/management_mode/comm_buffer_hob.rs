//! Management Mode (MM) Header and Buffer HOB Definitions
//!
//! Defines the header and buffer HOB structures necessary for the MM environment to be initialized and used by components
//! dependent on MM details.
//!
//! ## MM HOB Usage
//!
//! It is expected that the MM HOB buffer will be initialized by the environment that registers services for the
//! platform. The HOBs can have platform-fixed values assigned during their initialization. It should be common
//! for at least the communication buffers to be populated as a mutable HOB during boot time. It is
//! recommended for a "MM HOB" component to handle all MM HOB details with minimal other MM related
//! dependencies and lock the HOBs so they are available for components that depend on the immutable HOB
//! to perform MM operations.
