//! Arch-specific timer functionality
//! By default, this module attempts to determine the timer frequency via architecture specific methods.
//! (cpuid for x86, `CNTFRQ_EL0` for aarch64)
//!
//! Platforms can override this with a custom performance frequency by providing the Core with the correct frequency:
//!
//! <!-- (The below test has to be ignore because `patna` cannot depend on `patina_dxe_core` - circular dependency.) -->
//! ```rust,ignore
//!     let frequency_hz: u64 = 1_000_000_000; // Compute with platform-specific methods.
//!
//!     Core::default()
//!        .init_timer_frequency(Some(frequency_hz))
//!```
