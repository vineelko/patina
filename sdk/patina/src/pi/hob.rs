//! Hand-Off Blocks (HOB)
//!
//! Hand-Off Blocks provide a standardized method for passing information from
//! the pre-DXE phase to the DXE phase during the platform initialization process.
//!
//! HOBs describe the physical memory layout, CPU information, firmware volumes,
//! and other platform-specific data that DXE needs to continue the boot process.
//!
//! Based on the UEFI Platform Initialization Specification Volume III.
//!
//! ## Example
//! ```
//! use patina::pi::{BootMode, hob, hob::Hob};
//! use core::mem::size_of;
//!
//! // Generate HOBs to initialize a new HOB list
//! fn gen_capsule() -> hob::Capsule {
//!   let header = hob::HobHeader { r#type: hob::UEFI_CAPSULE, length: size_of::<hob::Capsule>() as u16, reserved: 0 };
//!
//!   hob::Capsule { header, base_address: 0, length: 0x12 }
//! }
//!
//! fn gen_firmware_volume2() -> hob::FirmwareVolume2 {
//!   let header = hob::HobHeader { r#type: hob::FV2, length: size_of::<hob::FirmwareVolume2>() as u16, reserved: 0 };
//!
//!   hob::FirmwareVolume2 {
//!     header,
//!     base_address: 0,
//!     length: 0x0123456789abcdef,
//!     fv_name: patina::BinaryGuid::from_string("00000001-0002-0003-0405-060708090A0B"),
//!     file_name: patina::BinaryGuid::from_string("00000001-0002-0003-0405-060708090A0B"),
//!   }
//! }
//!
//! fn gen_end_of_hoblist() -> hob::PhaseHandoffInformationTable {
//!   let header = hob::HobHeader {
//!     r#type: hob::END_OF_HOB_LIST,
//!     length: size_of::<hob::PhaseHandoffInformationTable>() as u16,
