# Platform Testing

Platform testing is supported through the `patina_test` crate, which provides a testing framework similar to
the typical Rust testing framework. The key difference is that instead of tests being collected and executed on the
host system, they are collected and executed via a component (`patina_test::component::TestRunner`) provided by the
same crate. The platform must register this component with the Patina DXE Core, which will then dispatch the component
to run all registered tests.

> **Note:** The most up-to-date documentation on the `patina_test` crate can be found on
> [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/patina_test). For convenience, some high-level concepts are summarized below.

## Writing On-Platform Tests

Writing a test to be run on-platform is as simple as setting the `patina_test` attribute on a function with the
following interface, where `...` can be any number of parameters that implement the `Param` trait from
`patina::component::*`:

```rust
# extern crate patina_test;
use patina_test::{error::Result, patina_test};

#[patina_test]
fn my_test(/* args */) -> Result { todo!() }
```

On-platform tests are not just for component testing; they can also be used for testing general-purpose code on a
platform. Any function tagged with `#[patina_test]` will be collected and executed on a platform. The test runner
can filter out tests, but you should also be conscious of when tests should run. Using `cfg_attr` paired with the
`skip` attribute is a great way to have tests ignored for reasons like host architecture or feature flags.

> **Note:** `patina_test::error::Result` is simply `core::result::Result<(), &'static str>`, and you can use that
> instead.

This example shows how to use the `skip` attribute paired with `cfg_attr` to skip a test.

```rust
# extern crate patina_test;
# extern crate patina;
use patina::uefi::boot_services::StandardBootServices;
use patina_test::{error::Result, patina_test};

#[patina_test]
#[cfg_attr(target_arch = "aarch64", skip)]
fn my_test(bs: StandardBootServices) -> Result { todo!() }
```

Next is the `should_fail` attribute, which allows you to specify that a test should fail. It can also specify the
expected failure message.

```rust
# extern crate patina_test;
use patina_test::{error::Result, patina_test};

#[patina_test]
#[should_fail]
fn my_test1() -> Result { todo!() }

#[patina_test]
#[should_fail = "Failed for this reason"]
fn my_test2() -> Result { todo!() }
```

### Test Triggers

There are three supported trigger types for patina_test tests.

#### Immediate

These tests are executed immediately on the `TestRunner` component being dispatched. They are only executed once. This
is the default trigger.

#### Event

These tests are triggered when a given event group GUID is signalled. A separate `on` attribute is used to indicate
this, e.g.:

```rust
# extern crate patina;
# extern crate patina_test;
use patina_test::{error::Result, patina_test};

#[patina_test]
#[on(event = patina::pi::event::END_OF_DXE_EVENT_GROUP_GUID)]
fn my_test() -> Result { todo!() }
```

These tests will be executed every time the event group is signalled.

#### Timer

These tests are executed every specified time interval (in units of 100ns, i.e. timer ticks). The `on` attribute is
also used to indicate this, e.g.:

```rust
# extern crate patina_test;
use patina_test::{error::Result, patina_test};

#[patina_test]
#[on(timer = 1_000_000)] // run every 100 ms
fn my_test() -> Result { todo!() }
```

These tests will continue to execute after the specified time interval for the length of UEFI boot.

## Running On-Platform Tests

Running all these tests on a platform is as easy as instantiating the test runner component and registering it with
the Patina DXE Core:

```rust,no_run
# extern crate patina_test;
# extern crate patina_dxe_core;
use patina_test::component::TestRunner;
use patina_dxe_core::*;

struct ExamplePlatform;

impl ComponentInfo for ExamplePlatform {
    fn components(mut add: Add<Component>) {
        add.component(TestRunner::default());
    }
}
```

This will execute all tests marked with the `patina_test` attribute across all crates used to compile this binary.
Due to this fact, we have some configuration options with the test component. The most important customization is
the `with_filter` function, which allows you to filter down the tests to run. The logic behind this is similar to
the filtering provided by `cargo test`. That is to say, if you pass it a filter of `X64`, it will only run tests
with `X64` in their name. The function name is `<module_path>::<name>`. You can call `with_filter` multiple times.

The next customization is `debug_mode` which enables logging during test execution (false by default). The final
customization is `fail_fast` which will immediately exit the test harness as soon as a single test fails (false by
default). These two customizations can only be called once. Subsequent calls will overwrite the previous value.

```rust,no_run
# extern crate patina_test;
# extern crate patina_dxe_core;
use patina_test::component::TestRunner;
use patina_dxe_core::*;

struct ExamplePlatform;

impl ComponentInfo for ExamplePlatform {
    fn components(mut add: Add<Component>) {
        add.component(TestRunner::default()
            .debug_mode(true)
        );
    }
}
```
