# Patina DXE Core Integration Guide

This document describes how to produce a Patina-based DXE Core binary for a UEFI platform. It covers workspace setup,
dependency selection, minimal entry scaffolding, core initialization, logging and debugging facilities,
platform‑specific service/component integration, build and feature options, and integration of the Patina DXE Core into
an existing firmware build process (typically EDK II).

It is important to understand that Patina delivers a collection of Rust crates (libraries) that are compiled into a
single monolithic DXE Core `.efi` image for a specific platform. Platform code is kept intentionally small and largely
declarative: you select implementations, supply configuration values, and register Patina components. The build to
produce the `.efi` binary uses the standard Rust toolchain (`cargo`) with UEFI targets like `x86_64-unknown-uefi` or
`aarch64-unknown-uefi`. The produced image is placed into the platform flash file (e.g. via an FDF in EDK II) replacing
the C DXE Core and select C drivers.

Patna DXE Core platform integrators do not need extensive Rust expertise to create a Patina DXE Core binary for a
platform.

---

At a high-level, the integration process consists of:

1. Selecting required Patina crates (core runtime plus optional capability modules)
2. Providing platform-specific configuration (UART base addresses, [MM
   communication](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina/blob/main/components/patina_mm/src/component/communicator.rs)
   ports, interrupt controller bases, etc.)
3. Registering [services and components](../component/interface.md) to extend DXE Core functionality
4. Enabling optional features ([compatibility mode](#91-compatibility-mode),
   [performance tracing](#73-performance-monitoring-optional),
   [memory allocation preferences](#92-32-bit-memory-allocation-preference)) as required

Throughout this guide, terms like “Component”, “Service”, and configuration locking refer to those concepts in the
Patina component model. These terms might be used differently than they have been in past firmware projects you've
worked in. Always check the Patina definition if you are unsure of a term's definition. See the
[Component Interface](../component/interface.md) for more details about Patina components.

General steps:

1. Create Rust Binary Workspace
2. Copy Reference Implementation
3. Add patina_dxe_core Dependency
4. Setup Rust Binary Scaffolding
5. Add DXE Core Initialization
6. Setup Logger and Debugger
7. Customize Platform Services/Components
8. Build Complete DXE Core

## Guiding Principles

To better understand why the Patina DXE Core is integrated the way it is, it is helpful to understand some guiding
principles that influence its design and configuration:

1. **Safety First**: Patina prioritizes memory safety and security by leveraging Rust's ownership model and type system.
   This means configuring and customizing functionality in safe Rust code.
2. **Native First**: Patina uses Rust's native features and ecosystem to avoid unnecessary abstractions and
   compatibility layers.
3. **Upstream Tool Second**: If the native Rust ecosystem does not provide a solution, Patina uses established
   tools or libraries available in the broader Rust ecosystem. In nearly all cases, for a given problem, the preferred
   solution will be one that avoids Patina-specific or proprietary tooling.
4. **Rust Only**: In the Patina repository, only Rust code is allowed outside of server CI support. All build processes,
   tools, and other code must be written in Rust. All functions a Patina developer **needs** to perform should be
   possible through a `cargo-make` task to simplify project maintenance and lower the barrier to entry for new
   developers.
5. **Simple Configuration**: The integration process is intended to be as straightforward as possible, minimizing
   boilerplate and configuration complexity. This includes all aspects of complexity including overhead for Patina
   project maintenance, tooling, Patina component writers, and platform integrators.
6. **Minimal Configuration**: Patina values safety above flexibility. Unsafe configurations are avoided. In
   extremely rare cases where unsafe configurations are necessary, they are opt-in and require explicit
   justification. Unsafe scenarios are preferred to be unsupported rather than to provide a configuration option to
   allow unsafe functionality. This means Patina is not appropriate for platforms that require extensive unsafe
   and legacy functionality.
7. **Agility**: In order to achieve Patina's primary goals of safety and simplicity, the Patina DXE Core must be able to
   evolve rapidly. This means Patina leverages its modified version of semantic versioning to remove technical debt and
   improve safety. This also means that Patina will not support legacy platforms or architectures. Patina's goal is to
   be the safest UEFI implementation available, not the most compatible.

All of this is to say that Patina is not a good fit for every platform. To use Patina, you will likely need to make
an early and deliberate choice to prioritize safety and simplicity over legacy compatibility and extensive
legacy compatibility.

## 1. Workspace Creation

Before starting, keep in mind that these examples might not be entirely up-to-date. They are provided to better
explain the Patina DXE Core platform binary creation process in steps. Refer to the latest Patina repositories for the
most current information. The repository that demonstrates Patina DXE Core platform integration is
[OpenDevicePartnership/patina-dxe-core-qemu](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-dxe-core-qemu).

---

First, create a new Rust binary workspace for your platform's DXE Core. Use a descriptive name appropriate for your
platform. In this example, we use `platform_patina_dxe_core`.

```txt
> cargo new --bin platform_patina_dxe_core
> cd platform_patina_dxe_core
```

You should see the following initial structure:

```txt
├── src
|    └── main.rs
├── .gitignore
└── Cargo.toml
```

## 2. Reference Implementation

Based on your target architecture, copy the appropriate reference implementation from the
[patina-dxe-core-qemu](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-dxe-core-qemu) repository.

### For x86_64 Platforms

Copy the Q35 reference implementation:

```txt
> mkdir -p bin
> cp <path-to-patina-dxe-core-qemu>/bin/q35_dxe_core.rs bin/platform_patina_dxe_core.rs
```

Reference: [q35_dxe_core.rs](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-dxe-core-qemu/blob/main/bin/q35_dxe_core.rs)

### For AARCH64 Platforms

Copy the SBSA reference implementation:

```txt
> mkdir -p bin
> cp <path-to-patina-dxe-core-qemu>/bin/sbsa_dxe_core.rs bin/platform_patina_dxe_core.rs
```

Reference: [sbsa_dxe_core.rs](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-dxe-core-qemu/blob/main/bin/sbsa_dxe_core.rs)

> While the QEMU Patina DXE Core implementations provide a good starting point, you need to modify the copied file to
> suit your platform's specific requirements.

### Copy config.toml from Patina

Copy `patina/.cargo/config.toml` to `bin/.cargo/config.toml`. This ensures that the platform is using the same
toolchain configuration as Patina has been verified with and recommends. A platform may customize the copied
`config.toml` as it wishes, but for best performance and stability, use the recommended settings. See the
[Patina DXE Core Requirements](./patina_dxe_core_requirements.md#35-configtoml-usage) for more details.

The `patina_dxe_core` crate build will fail if the config version has changed. A platform should use this as an
indication when updating Patina to repeat this step to get the latest config.

> **Note:** Patina will validate that the `PATINA_CONFIG_VERSION` environment variable is set to the same value as its
> `.cargo/config.toml`, so even if a platform updates toolchain configuration, it must keep the same
> `PATINA_CONFIG_VERSION`.

## 3. Dependencies

Inside your crate's Cargo.toml file, add the following, where `$(VERSION)` is replaced with the version of the
`patina_dxe_core` you wish to use.

### 3.1 Essential Dependency Set

Update your `Cargo.toml` to include necessary dependencies based on the reference implementation:

```toml
[dependencies]
patina_debugger = "$(VERSION)"
patina_dxe_core = "$(VERSION)"
patina_ffs_extractors = "$(VERSION)"
patina_stacktrace = "$(VERSION)"
# Add other platform-specific dependencies as needed
```

Review the `Cargo.toml` file in the `patina-dxe-core-qemu` repository for additional dependencies that may be required
for your platform.

## 4. Minimal Entry (efi_main) and `no_std`

Patina targets a firmware environment without the Rust standard library. The crate must declare `#![no_std]` and
provide a `#[panic_handler]`. The DXE Core entry function must be exported as `efi_main` with the `efiapi` calling
convention. This is an example of a minimal scaffold:

```admonish note
While Patina does not use the `std` library, it does use the Rust [`core`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/) library.
```

```rust,no_run
// #![no_std] // Commented out for mdbook compilation purposes
// #![no_main] // Commented out for mdbook compilation purposes
# extern crate core;
use core::{ffi::c_void, panic::PanicInfo};

#[cfg_attr(target_os="uefi", panic_handler)]
fn panic(info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
        // Consider integrating logging and debugging before final deployment.
        loop {}
}

#[cfg_attr(target_os = "uefi", export_name = "efi_main")]
pub extern "efiapi" fn _start(physical_hob_list: *const c_void) -> ! {
        // Core initialization inserted in later steps
        loop {}
}
# fn main() {}
```

Key points:

- `#![no_std]` removes the standard library; Patina crates provide required abstractions.
- The panic handler should log and optionally emit a stack trace (see later sections).
- The entry parameter `physical_hob_list` is a pointer to the firmware’s HOB list used for memory discovery and
    early initialization (see [HOB Handling](../dxe_core/memory_management.md)).

## 5. Core Initialization Abstractions

Patina exposes trait-based extension points enabling platforms to select or provide implementations. An example for
reference is the `SectionExtractor` trait used during firmware volume section decompression or integrity handling.

If your platform only requires (for example) Brotli decompression, you can supply just that implementation. Composite
helpers are also available.

Add representative initialization (replace or augment extractors to match platform requirements):

```rust
# extern crate patina;
# extern crate patina_dxe_core;
# extern crate patina_ffs_extractors;
# extern crate core;
use core::ffi::c_void;
use patina_dxe_core::*;
use patina_ffs_extractors::BrotliSectionExtractor;

struct ExamplePlatform;

impl ComponentInfo for ExamplePlatform { }

impl MemoryInfo for ExamplePlatform { }

impl CpuInfo for ExamplePlatform { }

impl PlatformInfo for ExamplePlatform {
    type MemoryInfo = Self;
    type CpuInfo = Self;
    type ComponentInfo = Self;
    type Extractor = BrotliSectionExtractor;
}

static CORE: Core<ExamplePlatform> = Core::new(BrotliSectionExtractor::new());

#[cfg_attr(target_os = "uefi", export_name = "efi_main")]
pub extern "efiapi" fn _start(physical_hob_list: *const c_void) -> ! {
    CORE.entry_point(physical_hob_list)
}
```

```admonish note
If you copy + paste this directly, the compiler will not know what `patina_ffs_extractors` is. You will have to add
that crate to your platform's `Cargo.toml` file. Additionally, where the `Default::default()` option is, this is where
you would provide any configuration to the Patina DXE Core.
```

## 6. Logging and Debugging

The DXE Core logging model builds on the standard [`log` crate](https://crates.io/crates/log). Patina currently
provides two logger implementations:

- [`serial_logger`](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina/blob/main/sdk/patina/src/log/serial_logger.rs)
- [`patina_adv_logger`](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina/tree/main/components/patina_adv_logger)

Select or implement a logger early to obtain diagnostic output during bring‑up. Configure UART parameters for your
target (MMIO vs I/O space). Below are platform patterns.

### 6.1 Logger Configuration Examples

In this example, we will talk about how to configure the loggers provided by Patina. The `SerialLogger` and
`AdvancedLogger` both have the same `new` method interface, so we will pick one for this example:

```rust
# extern crate patina;
# extern crate log;
use patina::serial::uart::UartNull; // UartPl011 (AARCH64) and Uart16550 (X64) exist
use patina::log::{Format, SerialLogger};
use log::LevelFilter;

const LOGGER: SerialLogger<UartNull> = SerialLogger::new(
    Format::Standard, // The style to log in - standard, json, verbose json
    &[("goblin", LevelFilter::Off)], // (target, filter) tuple to filter certain log targets to certain levels
    LevelFilter::Warn, // Only log certain log levels and higher
    UartNull {}, // The SerialIO to write to. Could be a custom implementation
);
```

### 6.2 Debugger Configuration

Modify the `DEBUGGER` static to match your platform's debug serial infrastructure:

```rust
# extern crate patina;
# extern crate patina_debugger;
use patina::serial::uart::UartNull; // UartPl011 (AARCH64) and Uart16550 (X64) exist

#[cfg(feature = "enable_debugger")]
const _ENABLE_DEBUGGER: bool = true;
#[cfg(not(feature = "enable_debugger"))]
const _ENABLE_DEBUGGER: bool = false;

#[cfg(feature = "build_debugger")]
static DEBUGGER: patina_debugger::PatinaDebugger<UartNull> =
    patina_debugger::PatinaDebugger::new(UartNull {})  // <- Update for your platform
        .with_force_enable(_ENABLE_DEBUGGER)
        .with_log_policy(patina_debugger::DebuggerLoggingPolicy::FullLogging);
```

#### Adding a Logger Example

First, add the logger dependency to your Cargo.toml file in the crate:

```toml
patina = "$(VERSION)"  # includes serial_logger
```

Next, update main.rs with the following, using Uart16550 or UartPl011 for X64 / AARCH64.

```rust
# extern crate patina_dxe_core;
# extern crate patina_ffs_extractors;
# extern crate patina;
# extern crate log;
# extern crate core;
use core::ffi::c_void;

use patina_dxe_core::*;
use patina_ffs_extractors::BrotliSectionExtractor;
use patina::log::{Format, SerialLogger};
use patina::serial::uart::UartNull; // Uart16550 or UartPl011 available for X64 / AARCH64 platforms

static LOGGER: SerialLogger<UartNull> = SerialLogger::new(
    Format::Standard, // Format to write logs in
    &[], // filters [(target, log_level)]
    log::LevelFilter::Debug, // filter level
    UartNull {} // The SerialIO writer
);

struct ExamplePlatform;

impl ComponentInfo for ExamplePlatform { }

impl MemoryInfo for ExamplePlatform { }

impl CpuInfo for ExamplePlatform { }

impl PlatformInfo for ExamplePlatform {
    type MemoryInfo = Self;
    type ComponentInfo = Self;
    type CpuInfo = Self;
    type Extractor = BrotliSectionExtractor;
}

static CORE: Core<ExamplePlatform> = Core::new(BrotliSectionExtractor::new());

#[cfg_attr(target_os = "uefi", export_name = "efi_main")]
pub extern "efiapi" fn _start(physical_hob_list: *const c_void) -> ! {
    log::set_logger(&LOGGER).map(|()| log::set_max_level(log::LevelFilter::Info)).unwrap();

    CORE.entry_point(physical_hob_list)
}
```

Note:

- The logger is created as a static instance configured for your platform's UART.
  - In this case we are writing to the Host-based STD Terminal. Your platform will require a different writer.
- Inside `efi_main` we set the global logger to our static logger with the `log` crate and set the maximum log level.
- The `serial_logger` provides a simple, lightweight logging solution that writes directly to the serial port.

## 7. Platform Components and Services

Patina uses dependency injection in the dispatch process (see [Component Interface](../component/interface.md)) to
execute components only when their declared parameters (services, configs, HOBs, etc.) are satisfiable.

This sections shows examples of how to add components and configure a platform. This is only for illustration; your
platform may not require any of these components or configurations.

```admonish note
This is how you would add components and configuration to your platform. You can author platform components and services
as needed and attach them here in addition to the Patina provided components and services.
```

Reference implementations: [QEMU Patina DXE Core](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-dxe-core-qemu).

### 7.1 Management Mode (MM) (x86_64)

In this example, Patina MM configuration definitions come from the `patina_mm` crate while the QEMU Q35 platform
components come from the `q35_services` crate. The `q35_services` crate would reside in a QEMU Q35-specific platform
repository.

```rust,no_run
# extern crate patina;
# extern crate patina_dxe_core;
# extern crate patina_mm;
use patina_dxe_core::*;

struct ExamplePlatform;

impl ComponentInfo for ExamplePlatform {
    fn configs(mut add: Add<Config>) {
        add.config(patina_mm::config::MmCommunicationConfiguration {
            acpi_base: patina_mm::config::AcpiBase::Mmio(0x0), // Set during boot
            cmd_port: patina_mm::config::MmiPort::Smi(0xB2),
            data_port: patina_mm::config::MmiPort::Smi(0xB3),
            enable_comm_buffer_updates: false,
            updatable_buffer_id: None,
            comm_buffers: vec![],
        });
    }

    fn components(mut add: Add<Component>) {
        add.component(patina_mm::component::sw_mmi_manager::SwMmiManager::new());
        // Platform Mm Init hook
        // add.component(q35_services::mm_control::QemuQ35PlatformMmControl::new())
    }
}
```

### 7.2 AArch64 Interrupt Controller (GIC)

For [AArch64 platforms using GIC](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0069/latest/)
(Generic Interrupt Controller):

```rust,no_run
# extern crate patina_dxe_core;
use patina_dxe_core::*;

struct ExamplePlatform;

impl CpuInfo for ExamplePlatform {
    #[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]
    fn gic_bases() -> GicBases {
        /// SAFETY: gicd and gicr bases correctly point to the register spaces.
        /// SAFETY: Access to these registers is exclusive to this struct instance.
        unsafe { GicBases::new(0x40060000, 0x40080000) } // Update for your platform
    }
}
```

### 7.3 Performance Monitoring (Optional)

The
[`patina_performance`](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina/tree/main/components/patina_performance)
component provides detailed UEFI performance measurement capabilities:

```rust,no_run
# extern crate patina;
# extern crate patina_dxe_core;
# extern crate patina_performance;
use patina_dxe_core::*;

struct ExamplePlatform;

impl ComponentInfo for ExamplePlatform {
    fn components(mut add: Add<Component>) {
        add.component(patina_performance::component::Performance::new().with_measurements(
            patina_performance::component::Measurement::DriverBindingStart
                | patina_performance::component::Measurement::DriverBindingStop
                | patina_performance::component::Measurement::LoadImage
                | patina_performance::component::Measurement::StartImage
        ));
    }
}
```

## 8. Complete Implementation Example

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating integration of logging, stack tracing, and component registration.
Stack traces are produced via the
[`patina_stacktrace`](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina/tree/main/core/patina_stacktrace)
crate when supported by the target architecture.

```rust
// #![no_std] // Commented out for mdbook compilation purposes
// #![no_main] // Commented out for mdbook compilation purposes
# extern crate core;
# extern crate patina_dxe_core;
# extern crate patina;

use patina_stacktrace::StackTrace;
extern crate alloc;

#[cfg_attr(target_os = "uefi", panic_handler)]
fn panic(info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    log::error!("{}", info);

    if let Err(err) = unsafe { StackTrace::dump() } {
        log::error!("StackTrace: {}", err);
    }

    // The breakpoint() fn only issues a breakpoint instruction if
    // the debugger is enabled and initialized.
    patina_debugger::breakpoint();

    loop {}
}

            comm_buffers: vec![],
        });
    }

    fn components(mut add: Add<Component>) {
        add.component(patina_mm::component::sw_mmi_manager::SwMmiManager::new());
        // Platform Mm Init hook
        // add.component(q35_services::mm_control::QemuQ35PlatformMmControl::new())
        add.component(patina_performance::component::Performance::new().with_measurements(

                | patina_performance::component::Measurement::DriverBindingStop
                | patina_performance::component::Measurement::LoadImage
                | patina_performance::component::Measurement::StartImage
        ));
    }
}

}
```

## 9. Feature and Memory Configuration Options

### 9.1 Compatibility Mode

The Patina DXE Core supports a compatibility mode for launching bootloaders and applications that lack
[NX (No-Execute) protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit) support, including most shipping Linux
distributions. This feature is disabled by default to enforce modern memory protection standards.

To enable compatibility mode, add the feature flag to your platform's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
patina_dxe_core = { features = ["compatibility_mode_allowed"] }
```

**Behavior:**

- **Disabled (default)**: Only EFI applications with `NX_COMPAT` DLL characteristics will launch
- **Enabled**: Applications without NX compatibility will be permitted to execute

See [Memory Management](../dxe_core/memory_management.md) for detailed information on memory protection policies.

### 9.2 32-bit Memory Allocation Preference

By default, Patina prioritizes high memory allocation (above 4GB), which helps identify 64-bit address handling bugs
in platform components. This behavior is recommended for development and production platforms.

For platforms requiring compatibility with legacy software that improperly handles 64-bit addresses, enable 32-bit
memory preference using the `prioritize_32_bit_memory()` configuration:

```rust,no_run
# extern crate patina_dxe_core;
# extern crate patina_ffs_extractors;
# use patina_ffs_extractors::BrotliSectionExtractor;
use patina_dxe_core::*;

struct ExamplePlatform;

impl MemoryInfo for ExamplePlatform {
    fn prioritize_32_bit_memory() -> bool { true }
}
# impl ComponentInfo for ExamplePlatform { }
# impl CpuInfo for ExamplePlatform { }
impl PlatformInfo for ExamplePlatform {
    type MemoryInfo = Self;
    # type Extractor = BrotliSectionExtractor;
    # type ComponentInfo = Self;
    # type CpuInfo = Self;
}

static CORE: Core<ExamplePlatform> = Core::new(BrotliSectionExtractor::new());
```

```admonish warning
Use default high-memory allocation for development builds to identify address width bugs during development. Only
enable 32-bit preference for production builds requiring legacy software compatibility.
```

For detailed memory allocation behavior, see [DXE Core Memory Management](../dxe_core/memory_management.md).

### 9.3 Resource Descriptor HOB Version Support

Patina DXE Core supports two mutually exclusive formats for Resource Descriptor HOBs: v1 (what EDK II uses) and v2
(v1 + cache attribute information). The version supported is selected at compile time using a Cargo feature flag:

- **Default (v2)**: Only v2 Resource Descriptor HOBs are processed. This is the default in Patina and is required for
  ARM64 platforms.
- **Compat (v1)**: If the `v1_resource_descriptor_support` feature is enabled, only V1 Resource Descriptor HOBs are
  processed in order to support an easy transition from EDK II. v2 HOBs are ignored in this mode.

Platforms are required to move to Resource Descriptor HOB v2s to accurately describe their system memory with caching
information.

In order to support easier adoption of Patina, a feature flag is provided to only process Resource Descriptor v1 HOBs.
This is simply added for bring up purposes and is not intended to be a production feature. Resource Descriptor HOB v1
support is enabled by setting the feature in the platform binary crate's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
patina = {version = "x", features = ["v1_resource_descriptor_support"]}
```

This will build and test the V1 code path by default, without needing to specify the feature flag on the command line.
For production, remove it from the default list to restore V2 as the default.

## 10. Build Process and Validation

The Patina DXE Core build process uses standard [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) tooling with UEFI-specific
targets. Reference the
[patina-dxe-core-qemu repository](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-dxe-core-qemu#building)
for comprehensive build examples and configuration.

### 10.1 Required Build Configuration Files

Copy essential build infrastructure from the reference implementation:

1. **`Makefile.toml`** - [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) task automation
2. **`rust-toolchain.toml`** - Ensures reproducible builds with a pinned Rust version
3. **Workspace `Cargo.toml`** - Dependency resolution and feature configuration
4. **`.cargo/config.toml`** - Custom target definitions and linker settings

### 10.2 Build Commands by Architecture

**x86_64 Targets:**

```bash
# Debug build
cargo make build

# Release build
cargo make build --release
```

**AArch64 Targets:**

```bash
# Debug build
cargo make build --target aarch64-unknown-uefi

# Release build
cargo make build --target aarch64-unknown-uefi --release
```

You can customize what [`cargo-make`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-make) tasks are supported in your platform by
customizing the `Makefile.toml` file.

### 10.3 Build Output Validation

Successful builds produce:

- **`.efi` binary** in `target/{arch}-unknown-uefi/{profile}/`
- **Build timing report** (when using `--timings` flag)
- **Dependency resolution logs** for supply chain verification
- **`Cargo.lock`** file for reproducible builds

[Binary Size Optimization Guide](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-qemu/blob/main/Platforms/Docs/Common/patina_dxe_core_release_binary_size.md).

## 11. Firmware (EDK II) Integration

Once you have your EFI binary, integrate it with your EDK II platform:

```mermaid
---
config:
  layout: elk
  look: handDrawn
displayMode: compact
---
graph TD
    A[EFI Binary] --> B[Copy to Platform Workspace]
    B --> C[Reference in Platform FDF]
    C --> D[Build Platform Firmware Image]
    D == Final Image ==> E[Platform Firmware]
```

### 11.1 Steps

1. **Copy the binary** to your platform workspace
2. **Update your platform FDF file** to include the binary in the firmware volume
3. **Build your platform** using the EDK II build system

### 11.2 Example FDF Entry

Add the EFI binary to your platform FDF file:

```ini
[FV.DXEFV]
  # ... other files ...
  FILE DXE_CORE = 23C9322F-2AF2-476A-BC4C-26BC88266C71 {
    SECTION PE32 = your_platform_workspace_dir/Binaries/platform_patina_dxe_core.efi
    SECTION UI = "DxeCore"
  }
```

## 12. Troubleshooting and Optimization

### 12.1 Common Issues

1. **Build failures**: Ensure all dependencies are properly specified and the rust toolchain version matches
2. **Runtime issues**: Check logger configuration and UART base address for your platform. For detailed debugging
   techniques, see the [`patina_debugging` README](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina/tree/main/core/patina_debugger/README.md)
3. **Memory issues**: Use 32-bit memory compatibility settings if DXE code usd on the platform does not properly
   handle addresses >4GB. Review [DXE Core Memory Management](../dxe_core/memory_management.md)

### 12.2 Performance / Size Considerations

For binary size optimization and performance analysis, refer to the
[Patina DXE Core Release Binary Composition and Size Optimization](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-qemu/blob/main/Platforms/Docs/Common/patina_dxe_core_release_binary_size.md)
documentation.

## 13. Further Reading

After successfully integrating your Patina DXE Core binary:

- **Component Development**: Learn about creating custom Patina components in
    [Component Interface](../component/interface.md) and review sample implementations
- **Debugging Techniques**: Set up debugging workflows using tools and methods in
    [DXE Core Debugging](../dxe_core/debugging.md)

## 14. Next Steps

With your Patina DXE Core integrated:

1. **Add platform-specific components** using the Patina component system as needed
2. **Configure additional services** as needed for your platform
3. **Test thoroughly** across different boot scenarios and configurations

Your platform now has a Rust-based DXE Core foundation. Continue iterating by refining service boundaries, expanding
component coverage, and tightening security controls.

## How Does This All Work with EDK II?

Since a lot of developers will be visiting Patina that are familiar with EDK II, this section is intended to help those
developers understand how the Patina DXE Core is configured and integrated with common EDK II configuration points.

The Patina DXE Core build is intentionally separated from the EDK II build process. The Patina DXE Core build is
meant to be performed in a standalone pure-Rust workspace. The output of that build is a single `.efi` binary that is
then integrated into the EDK II build process as a binary file.

The Patina DXE Core replaces the C DXE Core binary. At a minimum, this results in the C DXE Core being removed from the
platform build process and flash file. At this time `CpuDxe` is also brought into the Patina DXE Core too, for example,
and can be removed from the platform. However, because the Patina DXE Core is a monolithic binary, it also means
that as it increases the number of components and services it provides, the need for additional C components and
services decreases. Over time, fewer C modules will be required by the platform as their functionality is replaced by
equivalent code in the Patina DXE Core.

Library classes and PCDs are project-specific configuration points in EDK II. These are not supported in Patina. They
continue to work as-is for C code and the many C-based modules built in the platform, but they do not influence the
Patina DXE Core. Therefore, a platform does not need to change how configuration is done for their C code, but it must
be understood how configuration is performed for the Patina DXE Core.

Patina components take configuration input in two primary ways - through Patina configuration structures and through
HOBs. Platforms can populate these data structures from any source, including EDK II PCDs, platform configuration
files, or hardcoded values.

In Patina, we use [Traits](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/11/traits.html) for abstractions and
[Crates](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-01-packages-and-crates.html) for code reuse. To learn how to use these,
review the [Abstractions](../dev/principles/abstractions.md) and [Code reuse](../dev/principles/reuse.md) sections.

## Why Isn't Patina Built as Part of the EDK II Build?

First and foremost, Patina is a Rust project. It is a pivot to not only Rust but modern software engineering practices
that are common to a much broader set of developers than EDK II-specific processes and conventions and may not be
acceptable within the EDK II community. Patina seeks to engage closely with the broader Rust ecosystem and reduce
barriers to Rust developers getting involved in the project that have no need to understand EDK II.

Initially, the Patina DXE was actually built in the EDK II build process. In the end, this negatively impacted both
the EDK II and Patina/Rust experience.

The Patina DXE Core is built outside of the EDK II build process for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: The Rust build system (`cargo`) is significantly simpler than the EDK II build system. It is
   standardized, well documented, and well understood by the broader Rust community.
2. **Competing Build Systems**: The EDK II build system is not designed to handle Rust code. While it is possible to
   integrate Rust into the EDK II build system (and that has been done), it is not a first-class citizen and requires
   significant custom configuration. This adds complexity and maintenance overhead to the overall EDK II project and
   Rust developers that have no need for EDK II. For example, EDK II uses INF files to describe dependencies and
   resources used in the module that are resolved through a custom autogen system. Rust uses `Cargo.toml` files to
   describe dependencies and resources that are resolved through the `cargo` tool. These two systems are fundamentally
   different and work most effectively for their individual use cases.
3. **Competing Ways of Sharing Code**: We have found using crates on a registry is essential for efficient code sharing
   in Rust. EDK II does not have a similar concept. Tangling C and Rust code in repos introduces the potential for
   referencing Rust code in a C repo through a `cargo` git dependency or a path dependency. This prevents semantic
   versioning from being used as is available with crate dependencies. Semantic versioning is crucial for effectively
   having `cargo` resolve dependencies in a way that is sustainable. Placing Rust code in C repos has also resulted in
   dependencies being established like a path dependency to code in a submodule. This adds significant complexity to
   the overall and is unnecessary when working in Rust.
4. **Workspace Layout**: EDK II lays out workspaces a in specific way and Rust lays out workspaces a different way.
   While it is possible to make them work together (and we have), neither follows their natural conventions and adds a
   a lot of unnecessary bloat to the project. It is important for both that the workspace layout is organized a certain
   way as the layout has consequences on how the build systems work and code is written.
5. **Toolchain Overload**: It is frustrating for Rust developers to maintain and use C toolchains and build systems when
   they have no need for them. It is also frustrating for C developers to maintain and use Rust toolchains and build
   systems when they have no need for them. By separating the build systems, we can allow each group to focus on their
   own tools and processes without needing to understand the other.

In addition, `cargo` also simply builds Rust code fast and directly targets different scenarios like only build unit
tests, documentation, examples, benchmarks, etc. Developers can get results for these within seconds. The EDK II
build system simply serves an entirely different purpose than `cargo` and the Rust development model.

## How Do I Integrate the Patina DXE Core into My EDK II Platform?

The platform owner sets up a Rust workspace for their platform's Patina DXE Core. This workspace is separate from the
EDK II workspace. The platform owner then configures the Patina DXE Core for their platform as described in this guide.
Once the Patina DXE Core is built, the resulting `.efi` binary is referenced in the platform FDF file as a binary file
to be included in the firmware volume.

**Aren't two builds more inefficient than one?** No. It is much faster to iterate and build the Rust code with Rust
tools. Building a flash image requires a full EDK II build anyway so the fact that the Patina DXE Core binary is built
separately does not add any additional overhead.

```admonish note
Patina also has a [patching tool](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-fw-patcher) that can patch and run
Patina changes in seconds on QEMU. Separating the builds allows flows like this to be used that significantly speed up
development and testing.
