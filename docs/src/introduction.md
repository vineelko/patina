# Introduction

**Welcome to Patina** - a pure Rust project dedicated to evolving and modernizing UEFI firmware with a strong focus on
security, performance, and reliability. This book serves as high-level documentation for developers and platform
owners working with or contributing to Patina.

To put it simply, Patina is a [UEFI spec](https://uefi.org/specifications) compliant pure Rust DXE Core with an
interface for writing monolithically compiled [Patina components](component/getting_started.md) (drivers) using a
dependency injection model. It should be noted that Patina takes a more opinionated stance on some implementation
details to provide a more secure runtime, so we are not fully PI spec compliant. Due to this, there are some key
platform requirements that differ from a non-Patina implementation. See [Patina Requirements](integrate/patina_dxe_core_requirements.md)
for more information regarding this.

**This book is the "catch-all" for Patina:** it contains various documentation regarding Patina that can be broken up
into these 5 categories:

1. Background of Patina and its goals.
2. Integrating the Patina code into your platform.
3. Developing Patina components.
4. Contributing to Patina.
5. Development guidance and standards that apply to both Patina and Patina component developers.

If you have not read this book before, we suggest you start with **(1) [Patina Background](patina.md)**, which outlines
the project's goals and design philosophy. You can also watch an overview of
[Patina presented at UEFI Plugfest 2025](#patina-overview-at-uefi-plugfest-2025).

Patina is not the only way to write UEFI firmware in Rust and has unique goals compared to other projects. More details
are in the [Patina in the UEFI Rust Ecosystem](background/patina_in_the_rust_ecosystem.md) section.

## Patina In Action

If you want to see Patina being actively used and "in action", then check out these two repositories:

**1. [patina-qemu](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-qemu/):** This repository has two virtual
  platforms, both of which use the patina-dxe-core. You can find setup instructions for building and running them
  locally in that repository's readme.

**2. [patina-dxe-core-qemu](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-dxe-core-qemu):** This repository contains
  the patina-dxe-core binary crates used by the two virtual platforms in `patina-qemu`. If you'd like to experiment,
  you can clone this repo, modify the DXE core, and use the override feature in `patina-qemu` to boot with your
  customized build.

## Important Crates and Repositories

The Patina project maintains a large list of distinct crates throughout our various repositories
(See [below](#all-repositories)) in order to support proper decoupling and faster build times. If you are just starting
with Patina, there are two main crates that you should review:

**1. [patina_dxe_core](https://crates.io/crates/patina_dxe_core):** The library crate containing the [Patina DXE Core](https://docs.rs/patina_dxe_core/latest/patina_dxe_core/struct.Core.html)
struct definition. This struct is instantiated and configured by a platform in their own respective binary crate,
which ultimately compiles to an EFI binary.

**2. [patina](https://crates.io/crates/patina):** The SDK for working with Patina, whether you are creating a Patina
component or developing the Patina DXE core.

## Putting it all together

The [patina-dxe-core](https://crates.io/crates/patina_dxe_core) crate provides the UEFI spec compliant Patina DXE Core.
The Core produces the [EFI System Table](https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.10/04_EFI_System_Table.html) (with the core
provided services) and a PI spec compliant* [DXE Dispatcher](https://uefi.org/specs/PI/1.8/V2_DXE_Dispatcher.html).

Outside of UEFI spec compliance, platforms can attach Patina Components, which are conceptually similar to UEFI
components, but are pure Rust and monolithically compiled with the Patina DXE Core. Some components are written and
maintained by Patina, but are still optional. Over time, the Patina project will add more generically useful
components. We are expecting that additional components will be written by platform maintainers. These may be specific
to their platform or generic for the Patina ecosystem. See [Patina Component Model](component/getting_started.md)
for more information.

## Final Notes

```admonish info
This documentation aims to be as detailed as possible, not assuming any previous knowledge. However some general Rust
knowledge is beneficial throughout the book, and some EDK II knowledge is beneficial to understanding how consume the
final pure-Rust platform Patina DXE core in EDK II style firmware.
