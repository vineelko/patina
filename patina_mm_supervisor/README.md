# Patina MM Supervisor Core

A pure Rust implementation of the MM Supervisor Core for standalone MM mode environments.

## Overview

This crate provides the core functionality for the MM (Management Mode) Supervisor in a standalone MM environment. It is
designed to run on x64 systems where:

- Page tables are already set up by the pre-MM phase
- All images are loaded and ready to execute
- The BSP (Bootstrap Processor) orchestrates incoming requests
- APs (Application Processors) wait in a holding pen, checking a mailbox for work

## Memory Model

**This is a core component that does not use heap allocation.** All data structures use fixed-size arrays with compile-time
constants provided via const generics:

- `MAX_CPUS` - Maximum number of CPUs supported, supplied as a const generic argument to `MmSupervisorCore`
- `MAX_HANDLERS` - Maximum number of request handlers

This allows the entire supervisor to be instantiated as a `static` with no runtime allocation.

## Building a PE/COFF Binary

### Prerequisites

1. Install the Rust UEFI target:

   ```bash
   rustup target add x86_64-unknown-uefi
   ```

2. Ensure you have the nightly toolchain (required for `#![feature(...)]`):

   ```bash
   rustup override set nightly
   ```

### Build Command

Build the example MM Supervisor binary:

```bash
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-uefi --bin example_mm_supervisor --features x64,save_state_amd,supv --no-default-features
```

The output PE/COFF binary with AMD features enabled will be at:

```text
target/x86_64-unknown-uefi/release/example_mm_supervisor.efi
```

### Entry Point

The MM Supervisor exports `MmSupervisorMain` as its entry point, matching the EDK2 convention:

```rust
#[unsafe(export_name = "MmSupervisorMain")]
pub extern "efiapi" fn mm_supervisor_main(hob_list: *const c_void) -> ! {
    SUPERVISOR.entry_point(hob_list)
}
```

The MM IPL (Initial Program Loader) calls this entry point on **all processors** after:

1. Loading the supervisor image into MMRAM
2. Setting up page tables
3. Constructing the HOB list with MMRAM ranges

## Architecture

### Entry Point Model

The entry point is executed on all cores simultaneously:

1. **BSP (Bootstrap Processor)**:
   - First CPU to arrive (determined by atomic counter)
   - Performs one-time initialization
   - Sets up the request handling infrastructure
   - Enters the main request serving loop

2. **APs (Application Processors)**:
   - All other CPUs
   - Wait for BSP initialization to complete
   - Enter a holding pen and poll mailboxes for commands

### Mailbox System

The mailbox system provides inter-processor communication:

- Each AP has a dedicated mailbox (cache-line aligned to avoid false sharing)
- BSP sends commands to APs via mailboxes
- APs respond with results through the same mailbox
- Supports synchronization primitives for coordinated operations

## Usage

### Basic Platform Implementation

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use core::{ffi::c_void, panic::PanicInfo};
use patina_mm_supervisor::*;

struct MyPlatform;

impl PlatformInfo for MyPlatform {}

// Static instance - no heap allocation required.
// The const generic argument is the maximum CPU count used to size internal arrays.
static SUPERVISOR: MmSupervisorCore<MyPlatform, 8> = MmSupervisorCore::new();

#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop { core::hint::spin_loop(); }
}

#[unsafe(export_name = "MmSupervisorMain")]
pub extern "efiapi" fn mm_supervisor_main(hob_list: *const c_void) -> ! {
    SUPERVISOR.entry_point(hob_list)
}
```

### Registering Request Handlers

Platforms register additional supervisor MMI handlers by implementing
`PlatformInfo::mmi_handlers`, which returns a static slice of handlers. The core dispatches
its built-in handlers first, then the platform handlers.

```rust
use patina_mm_supervisor::*;
use patina::standard::efi;

fn my_handler(comm_buffer: *mut u8, comm_buffer_size: &mut usize) -> efi::Status {
    // Handle the request
    efi::Status::SUCCESS
}

static MY_HANDLERS: &[SupervisorMmiHandler] = &[SupervisorMmiHandler {
    name: "MyHandler",
    handler_guid: patina::BinaryGuid::from_string("12345678-1234-5678-1234-567800000000").into_inner(),
    handle: my_handler,
}];

impl PlatformInfo for MyPlatform {
    fn mmi_handlers() -> &'static [SupervisorMmiHandler] {
        MY_HANDLERS
    }
}
```

### Integration with MM IPL

The MM IPL (from EDK2/MmSupervisorPkg) loads this binary and calls the entry point. The HOB list passed contains:

- `gEfiMmPeiMmramMemoryReserveGuid` - MMRAM ranges
- `gMmCommBufferHobGuid` - Communication buffer information
- `gMmCommonRegionHobGuid` - Common memory regions
- FV HOBs for MM driver firmware volumes
