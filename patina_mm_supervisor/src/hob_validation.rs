//! Validation of critical incoming HOBs.
//!
//! The MM Supervisor consumes several HOBs produced outside of MMRAM by the MM
//! IPL. Because that producer is not part of the supervisor's trust boundary,
//! the data it hands down must be validated before it is acted upon. Validation
//! runs in two rounds during BSP initialization.
//!
//! ## Pre-paging checks
//!
//! Run before any HOB content is consumed and before the page table is
//! initialized:
//!
//! 1. The scanned MMRAM regions form a single contiguous, non-overlapping span.
//! 2. No `EFI_HOB_TYPE_MEMORY_ALLOCATION` HOB overlaps MMRAM (these describe
//!    allocations outside of MMRAM).
//! 3. Every `MemoryAllocationModule` HOB lies inside MMRAM, the modules do not
//!    overlap each other, and each module's entry point lies within its own
//!    allocation range.
//! 4. Resource descriptor HOBs (v1 and v2) do not overlap within the same
//!    version and address space (memory vs I/O). Descriptors owned by the
//!    Memory Type Information GUID are skipped, since the PEI memory bin HOB is
//!    expected to overlap the system-memory descriptors backing it.
//! 5. Every v2 resource descriptor carries valid memory attributes (exactly one
//!    cacheability bit for memory, no `EFI_MEMORY_UCE`, no attributes for I/O).
//! 6. The pointers reported in the MM Supervisor `PassDown` HOB reference memory
//!    inside MMRAM (and the HOB reports the expected revision).
//!
//! ## Post-paging checks
//!
//! Run after the page table is initialized, so per-page attributes can be
//! queried from it:
//!
//! 7. Every page of the MM Supervisor Core module is supervisor-owned (the U/S
//!    "SP" bit is set) and every page of the MM Supervisor User module is
//!    user-accessible (the SP bit is clear).
//! 8. Each module's entry point lies on an executable page (its `ExecuteProtect`
//!    bit is clear), i.e. it sits in the module's code section.
//!
//! Before the checks run, both the scanned MMRAM regions and every discovered
//! HOB are logged (at debug level) to aid debugging.
