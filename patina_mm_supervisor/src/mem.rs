//! Memory Management

//! This module contains the memory allocators used by the MM Supervisor Core and the shared
//! [`AllocError`] both of them report:
//! - [`page_allocator`] - SMRAM page-granularity allocator for general use
//! - [`paging_allocator`] - dedicated bump allocator for page table structures
//! - [`locked_state`] - the locked view over the bookkeeping the page allocator keeps in SMRAM
//! - [`mmram_placement`] - where an address range sits relative to MMRAM

/// Both allocators share this type. They differ in the backing structure, not in the ways a
/// request can fail, and the overlapping half of two separate enums only forced callers to convert
/// between spellings of the same condition.
///
/// Not every variant can arise from every allocator: `NotAllocated`, `InvalidAddress` and
/// `UnmapFailed` come from the page allocator's free path, while `InvalidSize` and `PoolTooSmall`
/// come from the paging pool.
