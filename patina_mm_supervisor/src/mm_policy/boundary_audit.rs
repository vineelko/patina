//! Firmware Policy Boundary Audit
//!
//! Reports, once when the policy is installed, whether the platform policy grants Ring 3 write
//! access to a register or port that defines the privilege boundary the supervisor rests on.
//!
//! The audit decides nothing. It asks [`crate::mm_policy::policy_gate`] the same questions a
//! syscall would ask and logs what it finds, so the supervisor keeps one place that decides what
//! Ring 3 may do. A finding means the platform policy needs correcting, and initialization
//! continues either way. That is what separates this from
//! [`crate::mm_policy::policy_validation`], which rejects a policy outright and stops the
//! supervisor.
