/// reading or writing user-owned (Ring 3) memory. The caller must re-enable SMAP via
/// [`enable_smap`] once the user-memory access completes, and must ensure every access
/// performed while SMAP is lifted targets valid, correctly-owned user memory. Prefer
/// [`with_user_access`], which guarantees the disable/enable pair is balanced.
